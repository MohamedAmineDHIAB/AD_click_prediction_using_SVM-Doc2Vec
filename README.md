# Clicked_prediction_using_SVM-Doc2Vec

This REPO contains a Data Science Challenge which consists of predicting whether and AD is going to be clicked or not depending on some given features. After some preprocessing and data analyse we have to choose which features are the most important as well as to determine the embeddings of the text contained in the Topic Line of the Advertisement. 

In the end we used Hold-Out Validation to assess some trained SVM models and got the following results :
